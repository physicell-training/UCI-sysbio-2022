# UCI-sysbio-2022

This repository collects notes, handouts, and other materials from the PhysiCell curriculum at the UCI Systems Biology Short Course (June 13, 2022.) See more at https://ccbs.uci.edu/education/fasb-sc/

## Preparation and setup
The majority of the PhysiCell session will be run using online web models, with optional work on C++ for the more advanced part of the session. 

### NanoHub registration
Participants should create a nanoHUB account in advance at https://nanohub.org/register. I suggest using the Google login option. 

### NanoHub model
Our session will use the [pc4learning](https://nanohub.org/tools/pc4learning) web app. For best results, use a fast connection. 

### GitHub
Participants not familiar with GitHub may want to use their very convenient desktop client. Get it at https://desktop.github.com/

### Slides and Materials
By Sunday (June 12th), full slides and materials will be available here on GitHub at https://github.com/physicell-training/UCI-sysbio-2022. 

I suggest cloning the whole repository with GitHub. Then you'll have a copy of all slides and code. Moreover, you can easily check for and download any updates. 

### C++ setup
The last part of the session will extend our web-based models to add C++ functions for more model dynamics. To participate in this part of the session, run our setup tutorials found at https://github.com/PhysiCell-Training/ws2021 	

## Slides
The live slides for the session are available here: [UCI-sysbio-2022 live version](https://github.com/physicell-training/UCI-sysbio-2022/raw/main/slides/UCI%20CSBC%20-%20June%2013%2C%202022%20-%20live%20version.pdf)

I also give extended slides here: [UCI-sysbio-2022 extended version](https://github.com/physicell-training/UCI-sysbio-2022/raw/main/slides/UCI%20CSBC%20-%20June%2013%2C%202022%20-%20extended%20version.pdf). 
The slides include: 
* additional mathematical detail
* complete the Part II online example 
* complete the Part III C++ extension
